# Language Experience Overview (LEO) Report Generator

In Singapore, more than 90% of adults are literate in at least 2 languages (Singapore Census, 2010). 
Singaporean families often involve grandparents in the care of young children, and one in five families employ a live-in foreign worker for domestic help (Singapore Ministry of Manpower, 2020). 
Infants in Singapore typically hear two or more languages from each parent, two-to-three languages from their grandparents (Woon, 2018), and possibly more from a domestic helper. 
Given this complexity, existing models of balanced/unbalanced or dominant/non-dominant bilingualism are insufficient for describing the rich tapestry of multilingual experiences. 
In order to capture this variety, we created a flexible multilingual tool, the Language Experience Overview (LEO). 
This multivariate multilingual tool combines estimates of care time and language-use ratios with language profiles of each caregiver. 
Importantly, the LEO Report visualises the results in parent-friendly feedback. 

`blipleo` is a Python package to generate Language Experience Overview (LEO) report.

## Usage

To generate a LEO report, prepare a LEO json data file (For sample see: [data/baby_test.json](https://github.com/BLIPNTU/LEO/blob/main/data/baby_test.json))
and use the following commands:

```python
import blipleo
leo = blipleo.read_json('./data/baby_test.json')
blipleo.generate_leo(leo, './data')
```

The generated LEO report looks like this: https://github.com/BLIPNTU/LEO/blob/main/data/baby_test.pdf
